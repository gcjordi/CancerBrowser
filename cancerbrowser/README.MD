### Instructions

Enter web project: `cd cancerbrowser`

Install dependancies: `npm install`

Serve this on port 8080: `node_modules/webpack-dev-server/bin/webpack-dev-server.js --content-base dist/`

Goto [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

##### Note:
It is also possible (but not what I'm currently doing) to have installed webpack and some other build tools globally so that you can just do: `webpack-dev-server --content-base dist/`
